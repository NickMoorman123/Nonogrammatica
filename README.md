# Nonogrammatica
The Nonogram/Hanjie/Paint by Numbers/Picross/Griddlers/Pic-a-Pix logic puzzle originates from Japan. The objective is to color in squares in a grid to reveal a bitmap image.
You are given the length/height of each sequence of filled squares occurring within each respective row/column of the grid, and must deduce which cells necessarily are filled or empty. As you fill in and cross out squares in one row or column, more information is obtained about the perpendicular column or row.
"Guess-and-check" or "if-then" logic should not be necessary to solve a well-designed nonogram. The solver embedded in Nonogrammatica will determine if the puzzle you draw or provide is solvable, so long as this is not necessary to solve.
